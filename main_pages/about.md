My name is Janet Vorobyeva. I love to work with interesting systems and solve problems. Probably as a result of this, I've worked a great deal with computer science and computer programming, especially with graphics/simulations. 
I also dabble in electronics and embedded programming. I am fascinated by early mechanical and electronic devices, as well as the history of computing technology and programming languages.


I studied computer science and mathematics at Stony Brook University, where I did my undergrad and my master's. Since then I've spent a couple years doing research work at Sandia National Labs, where I've worked on write-optimized data structures, computer systems, and computer architecture. As of 2022, I'm currently in NYC, teaching computer science at Stuyvesant High School.

I'm currently working for the HPC department at Stony Brook, performing Linux system administration and general problem-fixing.
This past summer, I worked at Grist Labs, a startup in NYC working on making spreadsheets more organized and more capable. Before that, I interned at a few other places. mostly doing internal scripting/automation.

I study computer science and electrical engineering at Stony Brook University. When not at school, I live in NYC.
