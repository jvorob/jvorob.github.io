My name is Janet Vorobyeva. I studied computer science and mathematics at Stony Brook University, where I did my undergrad and my master's. Since then I've spent a couple of years doing research work at Sandia National Labs, where I worked on write-optimized data structures for high-throughput data indexing, and on virtual memory systems for a computer architecture simulator. As of 2022, I'm currently in NYC, teaching computer science at Stuyvesant High School.

My CS experience covers a lot of disparate areas: I've done work involving high-performance data structures, scripting and automation, web development, networking, programming language implementation, computer architecture, and graphical/geometric computation. A particular hobby of mine is tinkering with esolangs, embedded systems, and historical computing technologies and programming languages.

I'm currently working for the HPC department at Stony Brook, performing Linux system administration and general problem-fixing.
This past summer, I worked at Grist Labs, a startup in NYC working on making spreadsheets more organized and more capable. Before that, I interned at a few other places. mostly doing internal scripting/automation.

I study computer science and electrical engineering at Stony Brook University. When not at school, I live in NYC.
