This site is a wip site for CSE300, and eventually will be my own personal website!

But in the meantime, it's mostly going to be a bunch of messing around with stuff in 
an attempt to understand how all this nonsense works.


### Technical details
  
This site was built in jekyll on a modified version of the Minima theme, hosted on github pages.
