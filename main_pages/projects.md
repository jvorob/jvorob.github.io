Here are a few of the things I've made in my spare time over the years (currently just the one)

### [Voronoi Diagram](/projects/voronoi)

This is an interactive Voronoi diagram app. It's implemented using doubly-connected edge lists

### [Tron Automaton](/projects/tron)

This is a block cellular automaton which makes neat digital-looking patterns


### [Morse Keyer](/projects/morse)

This is morse code keyer. It just beeps when you press a key. (this was surprisingly difficult to find on the internet)
